# Working with MLJ

MLJLinearModels while able to work independently of [MLJ](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl) has a straightforward interface to MLJ as could be expected with the naming of the package.

Using MLJLinearModels in the context of MLJ allows to benefit from tools for encoding data, dealing with missing values, keeping track of class labels, doing hyper-parameter tuning, composing models, etc.

TODO: example with BUPA liver data and robust regression with some hyperparameter tuning (also put it in MLJTutorials)
